# SPA Gallery
A simple gallery single-page applet written in PHP + JS.

Just drop it in your server, add folders with images or (browser-supported) videos in it, and access the page in your browser.
It'll automatically create a list of links to all found folders, and when entering a folder, links to all the images in it will be displayed and accessible.

Frankly not built to be particularly elegant or scalable, just functional for simple purposes and sort of as a proof-of-concept.
